# Nv2 Highscore Charts

This repository is used for storing files associated with highscoring in **Nv2.0** game, along with code necessary for presenting charts.

**GitHub Pages** is used for easy Web hosting. Just type the name of this repository and GitHub will do its job! (eg. [ngajic.github.io](https://ngajic.github.io))

I am using **Highcharts**' .js files to present charts. Code and many examples for it are available at their GitHub account: [*Highcharts.*](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts)

Score files were gathered from different sides thanks to Eddy's *N2High3.0* and organized per year of creation. [*GitZip*](https://kinolien.github.io/gitzip) is authorized to work with this repo ~~, so score files can be easily downloaded as zip bundles. Score files being stored in LFS, will make downloading only LFS references to these files. For downloading score files, best way is having git and git-lfs installed and cloning of this repository (to my knowledge).~~ Scores aren't stored in LFS no more, as I hit the limit, and don't wanna hassle around with billing stuff. They are know accessible regularly in my [*Google drive*](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UVRaXYf_891Z8pjrIOJb3qY2nyI0P-Ge?usp=sharing)

I was influenced by similar work of Hendor and zapkt.
