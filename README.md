# Nv2 Highscore Charts

This repository is used for storing files associated with highscoring in **Nv2.0** game, along with code necessary for presenting charts.

**GitHub Pages** is used for easy Web hosting. Just type the name of this repository and GitHub will do its job! (eg. [ngajic.github.io](https://ngajic.github.io))

I am using **Highcharts**' .js files to present charts. Code and many examples for it are available at their GitHub account: [*Highcharts.*](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts)

* For now only 0ths chart is available with score files dating way back in the beginning of Nv2.0 highscoring. Score files were gathered from different sides thanks to Eddy's *N2High3.0*
