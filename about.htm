		<h1>Nv2.0 Highscore Charts</h1>
		<hr>
		<p>This repository is used for storing files associated with highscoring in <em>Nv2.0 game</em>, along with code necessary for presenting charts.
		<p><em>GitHub Pages</em> is used for easy Web hosting. Just type the name of this repository and GitHub will do its job! (eg. <a href="https://ngajic.github.io/"><em>ngajic.github.io</em></a>)
		<p>I am using Highcharts' .js files to present charts. Code and many examples for it are available at their GitHub account: <a href="https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts"><em>Highcharts</em></a>.
		<p>Have spare time? Use your CSS and HTML skills at this <a href="https://github.com/ngajic/ngajic.github.io">repository</a>.
		<p> Currently there are 5 charts, which I update monthly (updating every day would require pushing every day and I care about servers at Github).
