		<h1>Nv2.0 Highscore charts</h1>
		<hr>
		<p>Hello everybody. This site right here has the intention to provide various statistical information about highscoring in <strong>Nv2.0 game</strong>, all this through usage of charts. Here, anyone interested in competing with others or themselves can find info about its completions, competitors, about number of 0ths, top10s etc. Pretty much, every chart has option to zoom it in or out, unselecting categories, exporting etc. Aside you can see navigation bar which should give you rudimentary idea of what you can find here. Without further ado, I will give explanation below:</p>	
		<p><em>Latest rankings</em> consists of one page where you can see the most important stats about highscoring. Here are charts representing current leaders in 0th count, with top being current grandmaster of the game, leaders in top10 and top5 count, as well as number of points (this kinda correlates players total score (PTS) from Nreality) and average score.</p>
		<p><em>Timeline charts</em> give insight in how rankings from previous section changed over time. Most interesting is to see how various players have taken or lost their grandmaster place, and from/to whom, as well as some other interesting facts and history.</p>
		<p><em>Level history</em> gives same timeline experience as previous section, but it gives information about 0th spot change for a particular level, which can be inspected by checking its check box. Here one can check how 0th owner, and the score for it, has changed for particular level, as well as some interesting facts about score disappearing, hackers with bloated 0th score etc. Due to the nature of static pages, this one loads all 600 histories at once, so it takes about a minute to load the page (assuming moderate connection speed).</p>
		<p><em>Position maps</em> give information about position of particular player on each of 600 metanet levels used in highscoring. Here a player can check where he has pure 0th, a top5, a top10 position, by inspecting the colors. As well to check what levels they haven't still highscored, or if they slipped of their leaderboards. Hovering over particular level will give the exact position tho. It is possible to deselect some labels, for easier looking, and to click on the map in order to load particular level page on <strong>Nv2 wiki</strong> if interested in how that level looks.</p>
		<hr>
		<p>Note! Due to the nature of static pages, only selected few players, which were active during some time, or left some significant mark, are eligible to be presented in these charts. In future, when I start developing dynamic site, this issue will be revised!</p>
